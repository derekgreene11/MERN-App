            <p>I am determined to complete a Master of Science in Computer Science. This is an educational goal that will prepare me for the ever-changing 
            landscape of software development. My ultimate desire is to use this acquired knowledge and expertise to become a successful software engineer. 
            This web application, highlights my knowledge of web development and popular technologies used in web development. After completing my Honors Bachelor 
            of Science in Computer Science, I plan to attend graduate school and seek employment as a software engineer.
